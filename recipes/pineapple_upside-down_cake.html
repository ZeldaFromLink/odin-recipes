    <img src="../images/pineapple.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Much like pizza, pineapple <strong>does</strong> belong on cake. This is a great treat for fruit and sweets enjoyers alike. While it may not look like your average cake, it is a delicious dessert to show off when you feel like doing something a little different.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 can (20oz) pineapple slices in juice, drained, juice reserved </li>
        <li>1 jar (6oz) cherries without stems, drained</li>
        <li>1 box yellow cake mix (check mix for additional ingredients)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In deep dish pan, melt butter and sprinkle brown sugar. Arrange pineapple slices on brown sugar, along with cherries. Press into brown sugar gently.</li>
        <li>Add water to reserved pineapple juice until you have 1 cup. Make cake batter from mix, substituting water for your new pineapple juice mixture. Pour over pineapples and cherries.</li>
        <li>bake 42-48 minutes. Immediately run knife around side of pan to loosen cake. Place heatproof serving plate upside down onto pan; turn plate and pan over. Leave pan over cake 5 minutes so brown sugar topping can drizzle over cake; remove pan. Cool for 30 minutes. Serve warm or cold, make sure to refrigerate.</li>
    </ol>
